## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I really liked studying web development when I was in college, so I wanted to further my knowledge in web building. That's what motivated me to join this program. In order to get a better understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, I worked alongside the course to build this project. This project will help me keep track of what I learned over the few weeks. I learned a few new HTML and CSS code, and gained a better understanding of JavaScript.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

I can use this study guide as a way to come back and reflect the start of learning web development. I can always add new notes and maybe even make a few changes to the study guide itself. This study guide contains notes of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
